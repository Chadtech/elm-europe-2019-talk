# HI THERE

This is my 

# Elm Gulp Browserify Boilerplate

Its basically a template development environment with my favorite tooling and what I believe to be the best practices. Its the repo I pull down when I start new Elm projects. It also might be useful to look at, if you are learning how to use Elm.

How to get going..
```
git clone https://github.com/Chadtech/gulp-elm-boilerplate.git new-project
cd new-project
npm install
gulp
```
then open up http://localhost:2957


This repo is organized as ..
```
elm.json
gulpFile.js
package-lock.json
package.json
public
└── index.html
readme.md
